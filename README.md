# sandbox

Just my personal **sandbox** to take some practice and try different *technologies*.

#### In my plans

1. Share some examples with plain technologies, like
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScrip 
in combination on couple of pages

1. Practice and share some React-components

1. Then may be some other examples:
  1. [Angular](https://angular.io)
  1. ![c#](https://habrastorage.org/webt/8w/rq/7v/8wrq7vfhyqv2saamr2d5z2jha5o.png)

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

```c#
public void foo(int number)
{
    return (number == 0)
}
```
